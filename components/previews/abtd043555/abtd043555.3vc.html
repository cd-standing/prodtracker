               <p class="p">Benign prostatic hyperplasia is one of the most common diseases in men and is often
                  associated with bladder outlet obstruction and lower urinary tract symptoms. The incidence
                  of benign prostatic hyperplasia in men aged 50-60 years is 50% and rises with increasing
                  age.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a> Treatment for the disease incurs a substantial economic burden, with estimated annual
                  costs of up to US$4 billion (£3.01bn; €3.45bn) in the United States in 2006, and mean
                  annual treatment costs of €858 per patient in Europe in 2003.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref2">2</a><a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref3">3</a> Owing to the demographic shift towards an elderly population, costs arising from
                  lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH-LUTS)
                  are likely to increase substantially. Surgical treatment is recommended if conservative
                  treatment fails or for patients with complications related to benign prostatic hyperplasia,
                  and is performed in more than 100 000 men annually in the USA.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref4">4</a> Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is still the surgical gold standard
                  in most patients.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref5">5</a><a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref6">6</a> However, it is associated with high morbidity,<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref7">7</a><a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">8</a> and 40% of patients have residual lower urinary tract symptoms that require drug
                  treatment within five years after surgery.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref9">9</a> These drawbacks have led to a continuous search for less invasive treatments.
               </p>
               <p class="p">Improvements in BPH-LUTS after prostatic artery embolisation (PAE)—a minimally invasive
                  procedure that can be performed under local anaesthesia—were first reported in 2000.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref10">10</a> Since then, nearly 1000 cases have been published, showing significant improvements
                  in BPH-LUTS, a favourable side effect profile, and lower treatment costs than with
                  TURP.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a><a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref12">12</a> Considering these advantages, non-inferiority of PAE compared with TURP as a reference
                  treatment would support its implementation as a treatment for BPH-LUTS. However, all
                  studies performed so far have been criticised for methodological drawbacks; only three
                  trials have included a control group that received established surgical treatments
                  for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the results were highly contradictory.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref13">13</a><a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref14">14</a><a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref15">15</a></p>
               <p class="p">The discussion regarding the use of PAE to treat BPH-LUTS is highly controversial
                  and is influenced by political interests, as a fundamental domain of urologists is
                  challenged by interventional radiologists. Evidence to support the use of PAE in the
                  treatment of BPH-LUTS is so far insufficient, and PAE is still considered experimental.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a><a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref16">16</a> The lack of high quality evidence comparing PAE and TURP is a crucial knowledge gap
                  in urology. We therefore compared the efficacy and safety of the two interventions
                  in a randomised, open label, non-inferiority trial.

                     the change in IPSS from baseline to 12 weeks. A change in IPSS of 3.0 points has previously
                     been shown to be perceived by patients as a “slight improvement” only. Therefore,
                     we considered a difference in mean IPSS change between both groups smaller than 3
                     points as showing non-inferiority for PAE.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref25">25</a> Based on previous findings,<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref29">29</a> a standard deviation of 4.6 was expected for the change in IPSS. Thus, if the true
                     mean difference was 0, a one sided <i class="italic">t</i> test with a significance level of 0.025 would have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis
                     that PAE was inferior to TURP, with a sample size of 38 patients per group. Assuming
                     a dropout rate of 20% during long term follow-up, we therefore aimed to include 100
                     patients.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p">The change in IPSS between baseline and 12 weeks was compared between groups by a
                     one sided <i class="italic">t</i> test for the non-inferiority of PAE, with a significance level of 0.025. An additional
                     analysis of the primary outcome was adjusted for IPSS at baseline by use of analysis
                     of covariance. Secondary endpoints were treated as standard superiority comparisons,
                     and means and 95% confidence intervals at baseline and each follow-up visit are reported.
                     We compared changes from baseline to follow-up visits between treatment groups with
                     two sided <i class="italic">t</i> tests for non-equality of means. All reported statistics were calculated from the
                     available data. Thus, occasional missing values for some secondary outcomes cause
                     the mean change from baseline to a follow-up visit (reported in text) to differ slightly

                     significantly for all other patient reported outcomes after PAE and TURP. IPSS related
                     quality of life improved by −2.33 points after PAE and −2.69 points after TURP (difference
                     0.35 in favour of TURP (95% confidence interval –0.30 to 1.00); P=0.15; <a class="xref" ref-type="fig" href="#f2">fig 2C</a>). The chronic prostatitis symptoms index improved by −7.83 points versus −7.16 points

                     and low quality evidence available for PAE,<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a> and outlines its advantages and disadvantages compared with TURP. Our results indicate
                     that similar degrees of improvement in symptoms are achieved with PAE and TURP in
                     the short term, although PAE has slightly smaller improvements than TURP. However,
                     clear advantages of TURP over PAE were found regarding the pure desobstructive effect,
                     reflected in improved micturition parameters and a reduction in bladder outlet obstruction.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p">Surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia is usually performed for refractory symptoms
                     associated with reduced quality of life; thus, patient reported outcomes are generally
                     considered the most representative primary outcome.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref5">5</a> In this regard, both TURP and PAE have yielded effect sizes in the improvement of
                     BPH-LUTS defined as “marked” elsewhere.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref25">25</a> Nevertheless, TURP has a more pronounced, pure urodynamic desobstructive effect than
                     PAE. Thus, TURP should be preferred in patients with complications associated with
                     bladder outlet obstruction, such as repeated acute urinary retention, bladder diverticula
                     or stones, impaired renal function due to bladder outlet obstruction, and weak detrusor
                     pressure combined with high amounts of postvoid residual urine (although some of these
                     patients were excluded from our study).
                  </p>
                  <p class="p">The apparent contradiction between patient reported and functional outcomes can be
                     explained by the poor correlation between urodynamic obstruction and subjective perception
                     of symptoms described previously,<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref30">30</a> and the fact that storage symptoms—which improve less than voiding symptoms after
                     conventional surgery—are usually more bothersome to patients.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref30">30</a><a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref31">31</a><a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref32">32</a> Similar findings have been reported for other minimally invasive procedures such
                     as transurethral needle ablation or microwave thermotherapy of the prostate and were
                     associated with higher reintervention rates.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref33">33</a><a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref34">34</a> In our study, considerably fewer and less severe adverse events were found after
                     PAE, which could be performed under local anaesthesia and was associated with reduced
                     blood loss and shorter duration of hospital stay and catheterisation than TURP.

                  <p class="p">Strengths of the study included its interdisciplinary study setting and the independent
                     trial monitoring and data management. The study population and outcomes after TURP
                     were similar to large series of real world data on TURP published previously and our
                     results seem to represent clinical routine.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref7">7</a> Moreover, the study followed up all patients treated according to randomisation,
                     and provided a detailed investigation of adverse events.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p">Our study has some limitations. The number of patients was not high enough to conclusively
                     determine non-inferiority or inferiority of PAE versus TURP, despite the difference
                     between the two procedures being less than the defined threshold of 3 IPSS points.
                     Non-inferiority could not be demonstrated conclusively in the primary analysis because
                     variability of the change in IPSS among patients in both groups (standard deviation
                     7.5) was larger than the value of 4.6 assumed in the sample size calculation. A main
                     cause for this discrepancy might have been different inclusion criteria and patient
                     characteristics in the study taken as a basis.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref29">29</a> In addition, the difference between PAE and TURP in the additional baseline adjusted
                     analysis was only slightly below 3 points (that is, 2.87; P=0.46 for non-inferiority),
                     which further outlines a need for larger scale trials.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p">With our study design, treatment groups might not have been perfectly balanced with
                     respect to prognostic factors other than the two stratifying factors—for example,
                     the degree of obstruction or comorbidities. However, separate analyses with adjustment
                     for all these factors showed that they were unrelated to our primary outcome (change
                     in IPSS) and did not influence test results for differences between PAE and TURP.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p">Blinding of patients and physicians was not feasible in the framework of our trial.
                     Therefore, both patients and physicians might have been biased in favour of or against
                     a new treatment. Expert bias cannot be excluded, because one interventional radiologist
                     performed all embolisations. The evaluation of patient satisfaction during mid-term
                     and long term follow-up will be crucial because of a potential placebo effect, the
                     fact that TURP might be more bothersome than PAE in the first 12 weeks, and the possibility
                     of a further treatment effect beyond 12 weeks after PAE. Moreover, the significant
                     difference between both treatments with regard to desobstruction might lead to higher
                     reintervention rates after PAE over the long term.

                  <p class="p">Evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of PAE in the treatment of BPH-LUTS has
                     mainly been based on proof-of-concept trials and cohort studies so far, and the three
                     published trials providing comparative data have had substantial methodological limitations.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a> While Russo and colleagues compared PAE with open prostatectomy in a matched pair

The trial<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref15">15</a> was not registered, and did not report on a clearly defined primary outcome measure.
                     The largest randomised controlled study published so far by Gao and colleagues<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref13">13</a> has been questioned by the opinion leaders in the field of PAE because of major inconsistencies,
                     including a limited adherence to fundamental standards of scientific practice, under-reporting
                     of adverse events, and an “over-reporting” of the results of PAE.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref35">35</a></p>
                  <p class="p">So far, little has been reported on PAE associated complications, and a higher complication
                     rate for PAE than for TURP in pooled analyses of comparative trials was attributed
                     to substantial under-reporting of complications after TURP.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">8</a><a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a> Our results elucidate these issues and illustrate that the scope of adverse events
                     after PAE—although favourable compared to TURP—has also been underestimated so far.
                     Preservation of ejaculatory function is a fundamental aspect for many patients and
                     has to be discussed before any treatment is initiated. Ejaculatory disorders have
                     so far been reported in only two of more than 1000 cases in the literature,<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a> but were encountered in our series in 56% of patients receiving PAE; this finding
                     was unexpected and needs clarification in the future.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p">Although duration of hospital stay and catheterisation are practice dependent and
                     were handled rather conservatively after TURP in this trial, PAE has been shown to
                     be feasible even without catheterisation and in an outpatient setting.<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref36">36</a> Radiation exposure of the patients receiving PAE was clearly below the thresholds
                     recommended for such interventions by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref37">37</a> and the mean total dose area product in this study was less than half than in other
                     studies,<a class="xref" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref38">38</a> indicating that the potential to improve radiation protection during PAE is currently
                     clearly not yet fully exploited.

                  <p class="p">Follow-up in the trials mentioned above was for up to two years. Although assessment
                     in our trial will continue for up to five years, the primary outcome was deliberately
                     assigned to the visit after 12 weeks, because patients expect an outcome of a surgical
                     intervention at this time.

                     provide valuable information regarding patient selection and counselling, and will
                     be useful for designing further trials in this field.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p">Larger scale trials and long term follow-up data are needed before PAE is implemented
                     as a routine treatment for BPH-LUTS. The large standard deviation in our trial emphasises
                     that such trials should also include subgroup analyses to detect patients who benefit
                     most from PAE, which was beyond the scope of our study. Future research should also
                     focus on the technical aspects of PAE, to determine the most efficient and safe approach
                     with this intervention. Further refinement of embolisation techniques might eventually
                     enable an even greater treatment effect. Owing to its favourable side effect profile,
                     trials comparing PAE with non-invasive treatments (such as 5α-reductase inhibitors
                     or combined treatments of α-blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors) seem to be reasonable.

                  <p class="p">This study shows that PAE is a valuable alternative to TURP in the treatment of BPH-LUTS.
                     PAE should be considered in patients in whom the indication for surgery is primarily
                     based on symptoms. For severe complications related to benign prostatic hyperplasia,
                     TURP should be preferred. Further comparative study findings including longer follow-up
                     periods and subgroup analyses should be evaluated before PAE can be considered as
                     a routine treatment.
